# Broadcast-Message
The code provided is a Python script that sends a broadcast message over a local network. The message "Hello, broadcast world!" is sent to all devices connected to the same network using the broadcast address "255.255.255.255".

The script uses the socket library to create a UDP socket and set the socket option SO_BROADCAST to allow for broadcast messages. The socket is bound to an arbitrary port number using an empty string as the IP address.

The script then enters a loop where it sends the message repeatedly for 10 seconds with a delay of 0.01 seconds between each transmission. Each time a message is sent, a notification is printed to the console.

Finally, the socket is closed when the loop is completed.

This code could be useful for testing or troubleshooting network connectivity issues or for broadcasting messages to multiple devices on a local network.
